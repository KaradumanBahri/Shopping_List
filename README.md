# shopping_list

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

 In this section, we created a shopping list application and implemented concepts such as form management, HTTP requests, data processing, and Firebase backend integration. You learned how to use the Form widget, establish a connection with a form key, and store entered values. This knowledge empowers you to handle complex forms and form input combinations effectively. We covered error handling, data retrieval, and the connection to a Firebase backend.
  Furthermore, we integrated this application with Firebase as the backend. This ensures that even if the app is deleted or the device is changed, the data remains secure on the Firebase server. This enhances user experience and data security.
